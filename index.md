Hello, I am Daniil Vinnik!
I am 20 years old developer from Ukraine with a background in computer graphics, currently studying generative machine learning.
In this blog I will share my advancements in machine learning and generative models,
alongside with my past work in computer graphics and game engine development including my own game engine "Omniforce",
and thoughts related to both fields.
